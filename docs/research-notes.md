# Research Notes

## CuLE Takeaways

CuLE demonstrates the thesis we want for NES: keep emulator state and rendered
frames resident on the GPU, run thousands of environments in parallel, and avoid
CPU/GPU observation transfer on the inference path. The paper reports up to
155M raw Atari frames per hour on one GPU and explicitly attributes the win to
GPU-side emulation, GPU-side rendering, and batching.

Important design lessons from CuLE:

- Use one logical emulator per GPU thread first. It is not theoretically optimal,
  but it is debuggable and already enough to beat CPU emulation at large env
  counts.
- Split execution kernels when their resource profiles differ. CuLE separates
  CPU/game execution from TIA rendering; NeSLE should separate 2A03 CPU/APU/PPU
  register execution from PPU frame rendering.
- Expect warp divergence after random policies decorrelate environments. Measure
  it and use reset-state caches, env grouping, and batch sizing to reduce harm.
- Render only when needed. RL commonly frame-skips and uses max-pooled or stacked
  frames, so many raw frames do not need full RGB output.

## NES Scope For Mario First

Super Mario Bros. is an NROM game, which is the right first target. NROM has no
bank switching, fixed PRG ROM, fixed CHR ROM, no mapper IRQs, and no cartridge
audio. That lets the first emulator avoid the hardest mapper problems while
still being a real NES emulator.

Core hardware needed for Mario:

- 2A03 CPU: NMOS 6502 core without decimal mode, plus NMI handling.
- CPU memory map: 2 KB internal RAM mirrored through `$1FFF`, PPU registers at
  `$2000-$2007` mirrored through `$3FFF`, APU/input around `$4000-$4017`, and
  cartridge space from `$4020-$FFFF`.
- PPU registers and enough cycle behavior for NMI, vblank, OAMDMA, scrolling,
  sprite 0 hit, background, and sprite rendering.
- Standard controller serial protocol through `$4016/$4017`.
- NROM mapper 0 with 16 KB or 32 KB PRG ROM and 8 KB CHR ROM.

Timing checkpoints for the initial NTSC model:

- NTSC PPU advances 3 dots per CPU cycle.
- Each scanline has 341 PPU dots and each no-rendering frame has 262 scanlines.
- Vblank flag is set at scanline 241, dot 1.
- Vblank flag is cleared at scanline 261, dot 1.
- The odd-frame skipped PPU dot and `$2002` vblank race behavior are deferred
  until the boot path needs that precision.

## Mario RL Surface

Mario reward and info should match the existing learning ecosystem before we
optimize. The useful RAM values are already established by `gym-super-mario-bros`
and Data Crystal:

- x position: `ram[0x006D] * 256 + ram[0x0086]`
- time: decimal digits at `0x07F8..0x07FA`
- coins: decimal digits at `0x07ED..0x07EE`
- world/stage/area: `0x075F`, `0x075C`, `0x0760`
- status: `0x0756`
- player state/death: `0x000E`, `0x00B5`

The baseline reward is progress plus time delta plus death penalty:

```text
r = x_delta + time_delta + death_penalty
```

with reset/death x jumps filtered out.

## Contra

The second scored game. `nesle/contra.py` decodes its RAM and
`batch_step.cuh` scrapes the same addresses on the device; the two are compared
step-by-step against each other in `tests/test_contra_reward.py`.

Addresses were cross-checked against the published maps and then validated
against this repository's own FCEUX captures of
`Contra (U) [T-Rus uBAH009 (12.11.2016)].nes`: stage agreed on 204 of 205
states (the one mismatch is a mid-transition capture), lives on 257 of 257, and
sprite X and Y on 52 of 52 each.

The parts worth remembering because they are easy to get wrong:

- **Score is the raw 16-bit value at `$07E2`.** The HUD displays it times 100,
  so using the displayed number makes every kill worth exactly the same.
- **`$0040` selects the scrolling axis.** Side-scrolling stages advance X,
  vertical ones advance Y. Reading the wrong axis makes the reward run backwards
  on half the stages.
- **`$0022` is the only reliable player-2 presence test.** `$0039` is not: the
  game sets P2 game-over status to 1 in one-player games too, and the P2 fields
  themselves are never initialised in a 1P game (observed lives `0x62`, score
  `0xFFFF`).
- **`$034E` is a flag byte, not a boolean** - facing and animation bits live
  there too, and 0 also shows up between lives, so lives plus `$0038` is the
  reliable death signal.
- **Game mode `$001C` non-zero means the attract demo**, which is not a
  playable episode and must not be scored as one.

## RL API Compatibility

Gymnasium single-env API returns `(obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info)`.
SB3 vector environments intentionally use a Gym 0.21-like VecEnv API:
`reset()` returns only observations, and `step(actions)` returns
`obs, rewards, dones, infos`. SB3 also expects automatic reset behavior and
`terminal_observation` in `infos` when an episode ends.
